# Blood Link - Blood Bank Management System
## Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Build a comprehensive Blood Bank Management System with multi-tenancy support, featuring:
1. Multi-Tenancy System (Blood Bank Network) - Organizations, branches, hierarchical roles
2. Security, Audit, Compliance & Admin Enhancements - Audit logs, context switching, user management

## Application Branding
- **Name**: Blood Link (renamed from BBMS)
- **Tagline**: Blood Bank Management System

## Deployment Status
- **Last Updated**: January 24, 2026
- **Status**: PRODUCTION READY
- **Database**: Clean (no demo data)
- **Testing**: All 33 backend tests passed, all 13 frontend modules verified
- **Bugs Fixed**: 3 model bugs (missing org_id in Screening, Donation, BloodRequest models)

## Core Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend**: React with Shadcn/UI components
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with role-based access

### User Role Hierarchy (4-tier)
1. **System Admin** - Global access, manages all organizations
2. **Super Admin** - Organization-level, manages own org + child branches
3. **Tenant Admin** - Branch-level management
4. **Staff** - Standard operations within assigned branch

### Key Database Collections
- `organizations` - Organization hierarchy
- `users` - User accounts with org_id and user_type
- `audit_logs` - Comprehensive audit trail
- `user_sessions` - Session tracking for context switching
- `donors`, `donations`, `screenings`, `blood_units`, `components`, etc.
