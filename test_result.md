        comment: "All Storage Management APIs working correctly. GET /api/storage returns storage locations list. GET /api/storage/summary returns proper summary with capacity alerts structure. POST /api/storage successfully creates new storage locations with proper validation. GET /api/storage/{id} returns detailed storage information with units and components.

        comment: "All Pre-Lab QC APIs working correctly. GET /api/pre-lab-qc/pending returns units awaiting QC (found 1 unit BU-2025-000068). GET /api/pre-lab-qc returns all QC records. POST /api/pre-lab-qc successfully processes QC checks and updates unit status (tested with real unit, moved from 'collected' to 'lab' status). GET /api/pre-lab-qc/unit/{unit_id} properly validates unit existence. QC workflow complete with proper status transitions."

        comment: "CRITICAL ISSUE: Processing multi-component dialog not opening when Process button is clicked. Page loads correctly with 16 blood units available for processing. Process buttons are visible and clickable, but clicking them does not open the expected dialog for component selection (PRC, Plasma, FFP, Platelets, Cryoprecipitate). Backend APIs are working correctly - component creation API tested successfully (created COMP-2025-000089). The dialog implementation exists in code but has a frontend bug preventing it from opening. This blocks the core multi-component processing feature."
