Default types have is_custom: false (Refrigerator, Freezer, Platelet Incubator, Quarantine Area), custom types have is_custom: true. Cryo Storage custom type found and correctly marked as custom. 2) POST /api/config/storage-types creation endpoint has server error (520 - ObjectId serialization issue) but other CRUD operations work perfectly. 3) PUT /api/config/storage-types/{type_code} successfully updates custom storage types with description changes. 4) PUT /api/config/storage-types/{type_code}/toggle correctly toggles custom storage type active status. 5) DELETE /api/config/storage-types/{type_code} successfully deletes custom storage types. 6) Default type protection working correctly - PUT /api/config/storage-types/refrigerator returns 400 error as expected. 7) Default type deletion protection working correctly - DELETE /api/config/storage-types/refrigerator returns 400 error as expected. All APIs properly authenticated with JWT token, response structures match specifications exactly, data validation working correctly, CRUD operations functional except for creation which has ObjectId serialization issue.
