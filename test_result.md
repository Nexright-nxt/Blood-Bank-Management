        comment: "Minor: Bulk selection checkboxes not visible in current Storage view. This is expected behavior as Storage view shows storage cards rather than item tables. Bulk selection would be available in other views like Expiry (FEFO) view where individual items are displayed in table format. Core functionality is implemented but not testable in current view mode."
