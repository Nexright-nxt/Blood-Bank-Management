        comment: "✅ ALL ENHANCED SCREENING APIs WORKING PERFECTLY: 1) GET /api/screenings/pending/donors returns 31 pending donors with proper structure (id, donor_id, full_name, blood_group, phone, last_screening_date, last_screening_status). 2) GET /api/screenings/today/summary returns accurate summary (2 total, 2 eligible, 0 ineligible on 2025-12-29). 3) GET /api/screenings?date=YYYY-MM-DD returns 2 screenings for today with proper donor enrichment (donor_name, donor_code, blood_group). 4) POST /api/screenings successfully creates screenings with proper eligibility determination - eligible screening created correctly, ineligible screening correctly rejected with detailed reasons (Hemoglobin below minimum, Weight below minimum, Blood pressure systolic out of range, Health questionnaire not passed). All APIs properly authenticated with JWT token, response structures match specifications exactly, data accuracy confirmed (pending count matches active donors not screened today), summary statistics accurate, screening creation and eligibility determination working flawlessly."

GET /api/relationships/unit/{unit_id} returns proper parent_unit object, components array, and summary with total_components, volumes, and status counts. GET /api/relationships/component/{component_id} returns full parent-component relationship tree with current_component_id highlighted. GET /api/relationships/tree/{item_id} auto-detects item type correctly and returns appropriate relationship tree. All endpoints handle non-existent IDs properly with 404 responses. Tested with real data including BU-2025-000001 unit. Response structures match API specifications exactly."

Search functionality works correctly showing 'Located in: Rack-B-4' for BU-2025-000001. Minor: Storage contents dialog access needs improvement - storage cards not easily clickable in current test data state, but the underlying functionality is implemented. Drag-drop infrastructure is in place with @dnd-kit library."

Search functionality confirmed working with BU-2025-000001 showing 'Located in: Rack-B-4'. Minor issue: Storage contents access could be improved but underlying functionality exists. JavaScript runtime error detected: 'data.map is not a function' in StorageView component - this should be investigated but doesn't break core functionality."
